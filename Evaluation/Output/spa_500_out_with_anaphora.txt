Resumption of the period of sessions[
]Declare restarted the period of sessions of the European Parliament, interrupted the Friday 17 December past, and reassert to His *Señorías my desire that they have had some good holidays.[
]As all have been able to check, the big "effect of the year 2000" has not produced . Instead, the citizens of varied of their countries have been victims of natural catastrophes truly terrible.[
]Their *Señorías have requested a debate on the subject for the next days, in the course of this period of sessions.[
]Waiting for that produce , in accordance with a lot of pals that have asked it to me, ask that we do a minute of silence in memory of all the victims of the storms, in the distinct countries of the European Union affected.[
]I invite to all to that we put us of foot to save a minute of silence.[
](The Parliament, of foot, saves a minute of silence)[
]Lady President, a question of procedure.[
]It will know you by the press and the television that have produced  a series of explosions and murders in Sri Lanka.[
]One of the people that recently have murdered in Sri Lanka has been to the Mr. *Kumar *Ponnambalam, the one who does few months visited the European Parliament.[
]It would be appropriate that you, Lady President, wrote a card to the President of Sri Lanka expressing the *condolencias of the Parliament by this and other violent deaths, asking him that do all the possible to find a peaceful reconciliation in front of the extremely difficult situation that is living his country?[
]Yes, gentleman Evans, think that an initiative like which you finishes to suggest would be very suitable.[
]If the Assembly agrees, will do what the gentleman Evans finishes to suggest.[
]Lady President, a question of procedure.[
]It would like me that it advised me on the Article 143 concerning the *inadmisibilidad.[
]My question refers  to a subject of the that will speak  the Thursday, day that in will go back to pose it.[
]The report *Cunha on the programs of direction *plurianual presents  to the Parliament the Thursday and contains a proposal in the section 6 around a form of penalties based in quotas that has to apply to the countries that do not fulfil annually their aims of reduction of fleet.[
]The report stipulates that it has to apply   in spite of the principle of relative stability.[
]I think that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the political *pesqueras community, by what a proposal that it *subvierta is legally inadmissible.[
]I want to know if it can do  this type of objection to what only is a report, no a legislative proposal, and if it is something that can pose the Thursday.[
]His *Señoría, if like this it wishes it, will be able to pose this question in this moment, that is to say, the Thursday before it present  the report.[
]Lady President, coinciding with the first partial period of sessions of this year of the European Parliament, lamentably, in the United States, in Texas, has fixed  for next Thursday the execution of a convict to the capital punishment, a youngster of 34 years that will call with the name of *Hicks.[
]On request of a French deputy, the Mr. *Zimeray, has presented  an application, whose signatories have been numerous and among which count me, however, of compliance with the constantly expressed position by the European Parliament and by all the European Community, ask him that it take part with the prestige of his charge and of the Institution that represents in front of the President and the Governor of the State of Texas, Mr. Bush, that has the faculty to suspend the conviction to death and of *indultar to the convict.[
]All this, of compliance with the principles that always have leaned.[
]Thank you, gentleman *Segni, will do it of very good degree.[
]It is, definitely, inside the line of the positions that their Parliament always has adopted.[
]Lady President, wanted to call the attention of you about a case of the that has occupied  one and again this Parliament.[
]It is the case of Alexander *Nikitin.[
]All celebrate here that the court have declared him innocent and that it have put of self-evident that also in Russia the access to the information on the environment is a constitutional right.[
]However, *sucede that goes to be accused again, as the public prosecutor will interpose a resource.[
]We know and we have affirmed it really in a lot of resolutions -precisely in the last session *plenaria of the past year- that this is not only a juridical case and that it is an error accuse to Alexander *Nikitin of criminal behaviour and of treachery, because we, as affected by his results, obtain benefit of her.[
]These results constitute the base of the European programs of the sea of *Barent and, thus, ask him that it study a draft of card that describes him the most notable facts and that do patent to Russia this position that is in accordance with the decisions of the Parliament.[
]Yes, lady *Schroedter, of good wins go to examine the facts related with this subject in what it receive his card.[
]Lady President, in the first place would like me congratulate it for having fulfilled with her promise since sure enough in this first period of sessions of the new year has expanded  drastically the number of canals in their dispatches.[
]However, lady President, has not done  what I had asked.[
]Well it is truth that now there are two Finnish canals and one Portuguese, but still there is not any Dutch and I had asked him a Dutch canal, because also the Dutch wanted to listen the news each month, when they command us to this exile.[
]Therefore it wanted to ask him again that it commission  that we can see also a Dutch canal.[
]Lady *Plooij-go *Gorsel, can say him that this question is in the agenda of the meeting of *cuestores fixed for the Wednesday.[
]I expect that it examine  with a positive spirit.[
]Lady President, could say me why this Parliament does not fulfil the legislation of health and security that in reality has approved?[
]Why it has not done  any test of quality of the air of this edifice since we have been chosen?[
]Why it has not celebrated  any meeting of the Committee of Health and Security from 1998?[
]Why we have not had fire drills neither in the edifices of the Parliament of Brussels neither in the ones of the Parliament of Strasbourg?[
]Why there are not instructions in case of fire?[
]Why they have not improved  the stairs from their accident?[
]Why they do not respect  the areas of no smokers?[
]It is totally shameful that approve a legislation and do not fulfil it neither we same.[
]Lady *Lynne, has all the reason of the world, and will verify if these things have not done  for real.[
]Also I will subject the problem to the Joint of *Cuestores, and am sure that the *cuestores will do the had to so that we respect the norms that, sure enough, we same vote.[
]Mrs. President, the Mrs. Díez González and I same had presented some questions on determinate opinions, reproduced in a Spanish newspaper, of the Vice-president, Mrs. of Palace.[
]The competent services have not included them in the agenda for considering that they already had been answered in an anterior session.[
]I pray that it reconsider  this decision because this is not like this.[
]The questions answered previously referred  to the intervention, in determinate file, of the Mrs. of Palace, no to these statements appeared in the newspaper *ABC on 18 November past.[
]*Señoría, go to verify all this.[
]I confess him that, for the moment, the things look me a so much garbled.[
]Therefore, we go to revise them with seriousness so that all was in order.[
]Lady President, would like me know if the Parliament will issue this week a clear communiqué on the dissatisfaction by the decision of today of not renewing the embargo of arms to Indonesia, considering that the immense majority of this Parliament leaned in the spent the embargo of arms to Indonesia.[
]The decision of today of not renewing the embargo is extremely dangerous #take the situation of this country.[
]Therefore, the Parliament has to send a message, since that is the desire of the immense majority.[
]It is irresponsible by the States Members of the EU deny to renew the embargo.[
]As it has said the people, the situation there is extremely precarious.[
]In fact, it exists the risk of a swipe be a member of the future.[
]We do not know what is occurring there.[
]Why they have to benefit the producers of arms of the EU at the expense of innocent people?[
]In any case, this subject does not appear right now among the demands of urgency for the next Thursday.[
]Order of the works[
]Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to examine the definite project of agenda, established of compliance with the article 110 of the Regulation in the Conference of Presidents, the Thursday 13 January.[
]Regarding the Monday and to the Tuesday, there are not modifications.[
]Wednesday :[
]The Group of the Party of the European Socialists requests that it include  a statement of the Commission on his strategic aims for the next five years, as well as on the administrative reform of the Commission.[
]It would wish that the Mr. Baron *Crespo, author of the request, took part to justify it, if to him looks him suitable, of course.[
]As always, we will listen to an orator in favour and to another against.[
]Lady President, the presentation of the political program of the Commission *Prodi for all the term of office was initially a proposal of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists that attained the unanimity of the Conference of Presidents in September and also the explicit acceptance of the President *Prodi, that reasserted his commitment in his speech of investiture.[
]Has importance this commitment in the measure in that the Commission is an organism that has the monopoly of the initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, configures basically what goes to be the political and legislative activity of this Parliament in the next *cincos years.[
]Memory besides, lady President, that this Parliament voted in two occasions in the anterior term of office his confidence in the President *Prodi; in this term of office voted it again in July and afterwards, with the new Commission in functions, went back in September to give him a vote of confidence to all the Commission.[
]Therefore, already there has been sufficient time so that the Commission prepare his program and so that we can know it and can explain it to the citizens.[
]In this sense remember the resolution of 15 September, in which it recommended  that it presented  the proposal in the most brief term possible.[
]The facts occurred the past week -that have originated  to the margin of the Conference of Presidents and using it only to corroborate and ratify decisions taken out of her- pose a dilemma: or the Commission is not in conditions to present this program (in this case would suit that it cleared it.[
]According to words of their President, is in conditions to do it.[
]Since the Commission is represented by the Vice-president, Mrs. of Palace, think that before voting would be convenient to know the situation of the Commission in relation with his availability to present the program, such as it had suited ); or the Parliament is not in conditions to examine this program, as it looks that they pretend some.[
]In my opinion, this second hypothesis would mean to do *dejación of our responsibilities like Parliament, in addition to entering an original thesis, a consistent unknown method in giving to know to the political groups by writing the speech *programático of the Commission a week before -and no the day before, as it had suited -, #take that the legislative program will argue  in February, in such a way that we could dispense of the debate, because the next day the press and Internet would have given it to know to all the citizens and the Parliament would not have already why occupy of the subject.[
]As my Group thinks that a Parliament is done to listen, to debate and for *reflexionar, think that there is not reason some that justify this postponement and think that if, the Commission is in conditions to do it, are perfectly to time to be able to reestablish the original agreement among the Parliament and the Commission and proceed with responsibility in front of our *conciudadanas and our *conciudadanos.[
]Therefore, the proposal that does the Group of the Party of the European Socialists and that their *Señoría has mentioned is that the Wednesday maintain  the presentation of the program of term of office of the Commission *Prodi, including inside this program also the project of administrative reform because, of not being like this, can find us with a paradoxical situation: with the excuse that there is not text, denies  by a part the right to the President of the Commission to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, that take place a debate on the reform without that this Parliament know previously the texts in that it bases .[
]Therefore, I pray him, lady President, that ask to the Commission that manifest  in this moment and afterwards that it proceed  to the vote.[
](Applauses of the group PSE)[
]. Lady President, want to leave very clear that, first of all, the Commission has the maximum respect by the decisions of this Parliament and, among them, the one to establish his agenda.[
]Therefore, we respect what in this sense can decide the Parliament.[
]But I want to leave also very clear that the President *Prodi engaged  with the Parliament to incorporate a new debate, as it has remembered the Mr. Baron, that adds  to the annual debate on the legislative program of the Commission, on the big lines of performance for the next period of five years, that is to say, for this term of office.[
]I want to say, lady President, that this debate distinguished , in the agreement to the that arrived  in the month of September, of what is the annual presentation of the legislative program of the Commission.[
]And I want to say, lady President, that, by the Commission, are poised and had to have this debate when it suit, that were prepared to develop it this week, as in principle it had agreed , splitting of the base that it presented  the day before in a speech to the parliamentary groups.[
]Therefore, lady President, want to reassert that, on our part, have debated the program of performance for the next five years and that are prepared for, when like this it decide it the Parliament, -this same week if that is the decision- come to expose the program for the next five years and, the coming month, the program for the year 2000, that was what was perfectly agreed.[
]I propose that we vote the request of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists to go back to include the statement of the Commission on his strategic aims.[
](The Parliament refuses the request) The President.[
]On the subject of the Wednesday, have another relative proposal to the oral question on the tax to the capital.[
]The group EPP-ED requests that it remove  this point in the order of the day.[
]Some pal will take the word for the group to justify this request?[
]Lady President, listen some laughs among the socialists.[
]They have said me that also wide circles of the Socialist Group see willingly the suppression of this point in the order of the day, since in the vote *habida in the Conference of Presidents was missing the vote of the group of competent work for this of our pals of the Socialist Group.[
]I ignore if this information is correct, but we like Group of the *PPE\/OF would appreciate in any case that suppressed  this point, since the Parliament has occupied  already numerous times of this question.[
]Also they exist agreements against similar tax.[
]Therefore, my Group requests that it suppress  this point of the day.[
]Thank you, gentleman Pöttering.[
]We listen now to the Mr. *Wurtz, that will speak against of the request.[
]Lady President, first of all want to underline the fault of logic of the gentleman Pöttering, that finishes to give a lesson to the Group of the European Socialist so that it go back  to treat a decision that took  of an absolutely clear way in the Conference of Presidents.[
]And he does the same.[
]We have argued, we express unanimity, with exception of the Groups of the *PPE and of the European Party of the Liberal Democrats and Reformist, and I same did to note -as they will remember it their wanted mates presidents- that does not treat  to know if they are you in favour or against of the tax *Todin, but to know if they dare to comprise what think in this regard the Commission and the Council.[
]It is not to ask too much.[
]Therefore, I reassert the proposal to maintain this oral question to the Commission and to the Council to know once and for all which is the position of these two organs regarding this relatively modest proposal, but that it would be an important signal for the opinion, especially after the shock that aroused the failure of the Conference of Seattle.[
]It votes  the proposal of the Group EPP-ED to remove in the order of the day the oral question referred to the tax on the capital.[
](The Parliament refuses the proposal by 164 votes in favour, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)[
]Lady President, want to appreciate to the gentleman Pöttering the advertising that finishes to give to this debate.[
]Thank you.[
]Lady President, has  *contabilizado her vote, that has not been able to be made electronically, because I do not have the card?[
]My vote was "in favour" .[
]Lady President, the Presidency has proclaimed the result of the vote.[
]They do not fit modifications.[
]Lady President, in the anterior vote -and will abide by me his decision in this subject- on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission, indicated that it would have liked me speak before the vote for my Group.[
]This has not occurred.[
]It would appreciate him that, to the closing of this point, allowed me  give an explanation of the vote for my Group.[
]It is an important subject.[
]It would be useful that the record of the Camera registered how perceives the people what have done to the light of his own political analyses.[
]Lady President, do not wish to restart the debate, but had asked also the word to give my opinion about the amendment of the Mr. Baron *Crespo.[
]Neither it has appointed me you.[
]I regret it, but the vote has made , has adopted  the decision and, therefore, leave like this the things.[
]I'm sorry a lot, gentleman *Hänsch, gentleman *Cox, have not warned that you asked the word.[
]In these circumstances, think that the positions are clear and that will reflect  in the Record.[
]When tomorrow it treat  the approval of the Record of the session of today, if His *Señorías estimate that the positions have not explained  the quite well, will be able to ask modifications.[
]I think that it is a good formula.[
]Of course that the Record of the session of morning will consign all the complementary explanations.[
]I think that this formula is better that the one to proceed now to some explanations of vote that would spend us long.[
]Mr. *Hänsch, Mr. *Cox, looks them well?[
]Lady President, if in the register of the vote states correctly how has voted my Group, neither want to neither can pose objection any.[
]If his decision is that we can not explain our vote, will observe it, but no wholehearted.[
]Advisers of security for the transport of dangerous commodities[
]Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the second reading (*A5-0105\/1999) concerning the common position of the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the applicable minimum requirements to the examination of the advisers of security for the transport of dangerous commodities by road, railway or by navigable road (*C5-0208\/1999 - 1998\/0106(*COD)). (Commission of Regional Politics, Transport and Tourism) (Speaker : *Dieter-*Lebrecht *Koch).[
]. (OF) Distinguished lady Commissioner, distinguished lady President, estimated pals, celebrate to a large extent the common position of the Council on the harmonisation of the formation of the advisers of security for the transport of dangerous commodities by road, by railway or by navigable roads.[
]In the first place: we have had to act in the formal terrain to satisfy the requirements of the Directive 96\/35\/*CE that obliges to the States members to the implantation of attendants of the prevention of inherent risks to the dangerous commodities or advisers of security, as well as to the organisation, schooling and examination of these people, without specifying this of explicit way.[
]Second: with this directive pretend: to) augment the security so much in the transport as in the transfer of dangerous commodities; *b)reduce the distortions of the competition that follow  of the existence of very different national structures of formation and of costs, as well as *c) establish the equality of opportunities of the advisers of security in the market of European work.[
]In third place, with the directive, such as it presents  now like common position and, especially, since it limits  exclusively to minimum norms, guarantee a tall degree of flexibility and a reduced regulation by the European Union, contributing like this to increase in tall degree the *autorresponsabilidad of the States members.[
]It is necessary to celebrate extraordinarily all this in the sense of the subsidiariness.[
]I consider that they have had  satisfactorily in account our amendments of the first reading.[
]They have been accepted, have put  in practice adequately or have not assumed  because they did not accept  the corresponding European regulations, for example, a system of sanctions for the cases of transgression or a complicated constitution of blocs of questions.[
]I ask the compliance of you for an amendment of the Commission of Regional Politics and Tourism, that has been approved unanimously and that refers  to the temporary realisation of the directive.[
]In the measure that do not impose to the States members any date for the put in practice of the directive, but we concede them a period of three months from the entrance in force of the directive, enter a clause of flexibility that guarantees a put in practice without *demora.[
]I ask the compliance of you.[
]Lady President, can not neither have to accustom us to listen every time with more frequency news of accidents in road or in the railway or in the navigable roads in which they produce  big harms, no only, but yes also, because the affected do not take sufficiently seriously the traffic of dangerous commodities or because with a lot of frequency, because of the ignorance or to the deficient preparation of the drivers or of other managers of the diverse means of transport, of a small accident has followed  a big catastrophe.[
]I like Austrian, but think that all we have still an alive memory of the catastrophe that the past year cost the life to numerous people in the tunnel of the *Tauern and in which afterwards it was necessary to reconstruct during long months and with a gigantic financial cost what was destroyed by the fire in the tunnel.[
]This *reacondicionamiento, that lasted several months, cut this important road of transport among the north and the south of Europe.[
]The consequent detour of the transport by this cause spent until the limit of the bearable to a lot of thousands of citizens of the EU.[
]In determinate locations of their country produced  really a chaotic situation.[
]The prevention has to be ours response to similar catastrophes, and with the present project of directive establish an important base to have of attendants of the prevention of risks, very formed, so that arrived the moment do  the correct.[
]Of course, we can not content us with creating Right European in interest of a main security.[
]Also we have to procure consistently that our aims are incorporated to the national legislations by the States members in the terms fixed and, even more important, have to procure that afterwards they are spent to the practice.[
]Please, that this was not another field in which afterwards we have to regret a deficit of execution.[
]It wanted to refer me to a last point: we do not have to content us with closing another hole in the net of the security and to continuation close the eyes in front of the fact that in matter of security of the transport in Europe remains still much more for doing.[
]In this regard I want to demand and ask to the competent Commissioner, that finds  here, that present the before possible the pertinent text to improve in the future the security in the tunnels, so that in Europe do not have to suffer catastrophes of such dimensions.[
]Lady President, in the first place wanted to appreciate the report of the Mr. *Koch that has centred  in the subject of the security in the transport.[
]The report treats of the question to harmonise the requirements of examination for the advisers of security that exert his task in the field of the transport of dangerous commodities by road, roads *férreas and fluvial roads.[
]I congratulate him by their excellent report.[
]Unfortunately, the security in the transport has been news recently: the rail accident of *Paddington, in London, the one of Norway, the two aerial accidents in which they saw  involved citizens of the EU, and the natural disaster caused by Erika in *Bretaña -*sucedidos all in the last four months- remember us that we never have to give by seated the security in the transport, and that the attendants to protect to the public have to be very motivated and highly qualified.[
]The speaker has signalled to the Camera that the Council has accepted in his common position six of the ten parliamentary amendments presented in first reading, and that has #take the essence of the others amendments of the Parliament.[
]Therefore, my Group goes to lean this common position and wait that adopt  a legislation that provide us another tool in our fight for augmenting all the possible the security of the transport in the European Union.[
]When it treats  of security my Group always will lean initiatives that augment the security in the transport.[
]As they have showed the recent events, still remains us a lot for doing on this subject.[
]Lady President, wanted to do some observations.[
]In the first place, I want to appreciate to the speaker his extraordinarily precise and technical work in this report, and second, want to appreciate to the Commission the proposal that has presented.[
]It treats  of the harmonisation of the requirements of the examinations, but in fact are speaking of the minimum requirements.[
]It is a pity in some sense.[
]The importance of the security of the transport by road, by railway and by navigable road is of course very big and, given the international character of the transport, the formation of the advisers of security would have to be harmonised, as also, for example, the requirements of the future *ADR.[
]This is important, but also is it the control and there is of course several motives by which have to devote him a particular attention.[
]Fix in the accidents in the road of the last years. For example in Belgium, the Low Countries and some other countries where, having fog, the trucks with dangerous commodities were still in route when they would have to have stopped in these moments.[
]Or pertinent ships of oriental Europe robbed at the side of other crafts where gives  a situation of danger more than evident.[
]Besides, it releases  of the investigations made in the ports in Belgium, in Finland, but also in Japan, that 50% of the containers with commodities partially dangerous do not hand  correctly.[
]Said of another form, is of big importance.[
]When contemplating the situation of the advisers of security, see that in some countries is compulsory to count in the companies with said advisers of security from 1 January of this year.[
]In this moment this causes big problems of control especially in the small companies, because they can not it pay.[
]Then, or they will refuse these commodities or will mix them with other and this will cause some problems.[
]Thus, It is asking  an evaluation of these activities in shape of annual reports, analysis of companies, that could incorporate  *eventualmente in the certified ISO 9002.[
]The rules are, now remains the control.[
]Allow me that mention a last question.[
]With regard to the control, have to arrive to some good agreements with the countries of Oriental Europe, because until 1 July 2001, or was to within of a year and half, will not take part in the treaties on this matter.[
]This gives them a temporary competitive advantage.[
]It is not grave in yes, but what would have to do especially is to give priority to the appearances of security in the transport of commodities by road, by railway and by navigable road and incorporate this part of the *acervo community the more quickly possible and present it to the countries candidates to the adhesion.[
]Lady President, in this Parliament with reason loans  attention regularly to the importance of the security in the transport.[
]The increasing quantities of commodities that go through Europe, comport risks of which are conscious and sometimes unaware, for the personnel and for the social surroundings.[
]The people that have to handle these risks, have to fulfil therefore some tall requirements.[
]The norms that for this have drafted  in another directive, the 95\/35\/*CE, look the sufficiently adapted to advise of reasonable form to the people on the organisation of the transport of dangerous commodities.[
]I gladden me that there is also an agreement with the Council on the minimum requirements for their examination, although it had preferred that they had created  some fixed and uniform norms, so that the certificates were equal from the international point of view.[
]This, nevertheless, was not possible.[
]Finally, the amendment that has presented the speaker, looks me more than logic and, therefore, the support fully.[
]Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated pals, first of all, wanted to congratulate to their pal, the Mr. *Koch, by his reports, which perhaps are technical reports, but *revisten a big importance for the security.[
]I wish to do only some *puntualizaciones.[
]In the first place, I want to ask to the Mrs. Commissioner -and am sure that her desire falls in fertile soil- that devote a main attention to the question of the security, was this in road, in railway or in the fluvial roads.[
]When I see that the first amendment of the Commission was presented on 19 March 1998 and that are occupying us still of this -and in this regard the Parliament has reacted with relative rapidity- the period of time is too long.[
]This is not now blames of the Commission only, but think that have to react with main rapidity and attain a main harmonisation in this point.[
]The second point also has been mentioned already: the minimum norms.[
]Fundamentally, I am of the opinion that in a lot of fields of the transport it would be necessary to aspire to a main flexibility and to some regulations elaborated by the countries.[
]In the case of the security am a so much sceptic because the security in Sweden, for example, does not differentiate , in principle, of the security in Germany, in Italy or in Austria.[
]I can live with these minimum norms, but ask to the Commission that do a real and accurate follow-up of the things.[
]If this type of flexibility drove in some countries to insufficient regulations, would have to undertake a harmonisation *ulterior.[
]The third point has been mentioned also: the same that our pal, the Mr. *Rack, proceed of a country of traffic in which this question exerts a special paper.[
]We do not want to worsen the conditions of the competition of unilateral way for some countries and improve them for countries like Austria or other countries of traffic.[
]But I think that all have to do all the possible to restrict the transport of dangerous commodities and, by the way, in all the countries, are countries of traffic or no.[
]. Gentleman President, in the first place want to congratulate to the speaker, Mr. *Koch, by his glorious work and by his positive collaboration with the Commission to the hour to improve the texts, to present this report and this proposal; at the end, only there is a relative amendment to the requirements of the examination of aptitude of the advisers of security for the transport of dangerous commodities by road, railway or navigable road.[
]We understand that it is important the collaboration, the work in common by the two institutions -Parliament and Commission- and that the collaboration that exists with the Commission of Regional Politics, and specifically with the group of transports, is glorious.[
]The common position includes practically all the amendments accepted by the Commission, harmonises the minimum requirements of the examinations of the advisers of security and, in second reading, can accept the amendment on the date proposed, much more realistic that the posed in principle by the Commission, #take that we already spend several years debating on this question.[
]*Brevísimamente, want to appreciate also the intervention of the distinct deputies and say them to their *Señorías that the security is a priority of the Commission in the field of the transports.[
]And as very well it has said the Mr. Simpson, never can  #take or by purchased or by culminated the process.[
]The process to increase the margins, the guarantees of security in the transports is a process that it is necessary to go improving day in day out.[
]In this sense, want to refer me also very in brief to the problems of the tunnels, to that have done reference the Gentlemen *Rack and Swoboda, that, undoubtedly, in the case of Austria, is a very sensitive subject, by what it is necessary to do endeavours to see how increase their security.[
]In one of the big accidents occurred lately, the commodity transported was not in himself dangerous.[
]The margarine and some kilos of painting that, in principle, did not pose risks, caused a true catastrophe.[
]Therefore, it is necessary to see how can fine-tune  even more the requirements that allow to guarantee a maximum of security.[
]Finally, it wanted to say that it is necessary to contemplate the security in all the types of transport.[
]This week will celebrate here a debate to speak of the security of the maritime transport, because of the catastrophe of Erika, and will have to argue, along this year, on the aims, in matter of security, of the aerial transport.[
]But I want to say, *Señorías, that the security is an aim *prioritario of the Commission.[
]As I will say in the debate on Erika, do not expect to that there is a catastrophe to dump us on the appearance of the security, but we work in this to the margin of these circumstances, that the only that do is to show the urgency of an effective response to this type of problems.[
]I want to reassert their gratitude to all those that have taken part and very especially to the speaker, Mr. *Koch.[
]The debate remains closed.[
]The vote will take place morning to the 12.00 hours.[
]Transport of dangerous commodities by road[
]Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the report (*A5-0104\/1999) of the Mr. *Koch, for the Commission of Regional Politics, Transports and Tourism, on a proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (*COM(1999) 158 - *C5-0004\/1999 - 1999\/0083(*COD)) by which modifies  the Directive 94\/55\/*CE on the approximation of the legislations of the States members regarding the transport of dangerous commodities by road.[
]Gentleman President, distinguished lady Commissioner, estimated pals, the relative directive to the approximation of the legislations of the States members on the transport of dangerous commodities by road, that went in in force on 1 January 1997, contains some transitory disposals whose force is subjected to term and finds  linked to the conclusion of determinate works of normalisation of the *CEN, that is to say, of the European Committee of Normalisation.[
]Now well, some postponements that have produced  in the works of the *CEN are originating problems to the hour of the application of this directive.[
]Especially, it is not possible to adapt the annexes in accordance with the technical and industrial development.[
]I regret this, as we have to act because others have not made his work.[
]In this sense accept the present proposal, that today subjects  to debate, on the modification of the Directive 94\/55\/*CE.[
]The inactivity of the European Union would oblige to the States members to modify their juridical norms *intraestatales for a short period of time, in concrete, until the conclusion of the works of the *CEN, which originates costs and unnecessary insecurities.[
]Therefore, the modification of the directive, that appears today in the agenda, does not produce any change in the harmonisation of the transport of dangerous commodities that is #carry in the Community.[
]*Prorroga Only some transitory disposals by means of the postponement of the temporary limits, does not suppress more specific disposals and regulates the procedures for to) the ad hoc transports of dangerous commodities, as well as for *b) the approval of national disposals less rigorous, especially in the case of the transport of quantities very small of dangerous commodities in territories locally very delimited.[
]Of this luck the modification of the directive does  entirely in the sense of the subsidiariness; the States members purchase more faculties.[
]The Commission of the EU decide if the States members can dictate determinate own disposals.[
]In this regard it is assisted, in accordance with the normative procedure, by a Committee of experts in matter of transport of dangerous commodities.[
]The modalities of exercise of these faculties of execution transferred to the Commission were regulated by first time by agreement of the Council of June of 1999.[
]The proposal of modification of the relative directive to the transport of dangerous commodities by road, that today finds  subjected to debate, dates of May of 1999 and, in consequence, has not been able to cost still of the current procedure of *comitología.[
]The amendments that have presented  and that have been approved unanimously in the commission refer  precisely in two cases to this modified procedure of *comitología.[
]We wanted to ensure that it allude  already to this in the *considerandos and that the term, *imprecisamente formulated, inside the *cual the Council has to adopt a decision, fix  in three months at most.[
]By the other alludes  also to the need of a main transparency.[
]Another amendment allows to the States members establish requirements more strict, especially for the tanks to the empty, when the work or the transport have to make  preferably to temperatures considerably inferior to the 20 low degrees zero.[
]This interests especially to the north regions of Europe.[
]A last amendment goes directed to *propiciar that follow  authorising the utilisation of the tanks and vehicles *cisterna that have gone in into use among 1 January 1997 and the entrance in force of this directive, if his construction and maintenance adjust  to the willing.[
]Conscious also that this is not more than a small step to a main security, ask them to you his compliance for the present report.[
]Gentleman President, *señorías, happy New and happy Year Millenium.[
]I take part for the first time in a session *plenaria, so that this is thrilling, a bit like the first amour, only that the first amour lasted more than two minutes.[
]It wanted to comment in brief the proposal presented by the Commission that will modify the directive in force on the transport of dangerous commodities by road.[
]It is well that adopt  this directive now because, of the contrary, the States members would see  obliged to modify their national legislations for a very brief term, for a period of transition, thing that, to his time, only would originate unnecessary costs and would augment once again the *quebraderos of head of the citizens in front of the bureaucracy of the EU.[
]However, the proposal of the Commission has not taken in account all the factors as, for example, the cold climate of the northern regions.[
]Like this then , I proposed some amendments to the splendid report of my pal, the Mr. *Koch, that were approved by our parliamentary commission.[
]My amendments refer  to the resistance to the low temperatures of the deposits of transport of these dangerous commodities.[
]In accordance with the proposal of the Commission, had sufficed a resistance to the 20 low degrees zero; in the beaches of the Mediterranean is difficult to imagine that in *Laponia give  temperatures considerably lower.[
]Also in *Laponia leans  to the EU, so agree us of them.[
]Therefore, I have proposed that it descend  the limit of resistance to the 40 low degrees zero.[
]This would be truly necessary so that the level of security maintain  in the northern regions.[
]I expect that their proposal was taken in account in the vote of morning.[
]Gentleman President, if it allows it to me, wanted to manifest him first of all his respect by the form in that you has #carry the agile change in the Presidency during the debate.[
]I have found it glorious.[
]I go in in the subject: I think that the citizens of Europe can trust that what transports  in Europe by road, by railway or by the navigable roads transports  with all the possible security, even being dangerous commodities.[
]This managerial is a contribution to this.[
]What are doing today constitutes a scandal.[
]The speaker, Mr. *Koch, to the that thank for the work that has #carry, has alluded to that deep down all could be more advanced if it did not exist this *demora of the *CEN that are very slow in the preparation and in the adaptation of the directive.[
]For this reason, it does not remain us more than expecting -and would have to decide this in this week- that in the 2001 have, at last, of community regulations for the transport of dangerous commodities by road, so that in this point have a bit of juridical security and also a bit more than security in our roads.[
]Gentleman President, the report that are treating does not represent big changes.[
]The majority of the amendments are exclusively of technical character.[
]However, it is worthwhile to underline that this class of decisions is profitable from the environmental point of view and because it creates better conditions for the operation of the inner market.[
]In the EU transport  big quantities of dangerous commodities by roads, by railways and by sea.[
]They need  norms that regulate this transport.[
]Sector after sector is being regulated by minimum norms that oblige to the States members.[
]This is extraordinarily profitable and give the thanks to the speaker *Koch by the work made in relation with this matter.[
]This also is important regarding the conditions for the inner market.[
]So that the market of common transports really work no only is important that exist rules, but also these rules, in the measure of the possible, are common.[
]Finally it wanted to comment a third thing that also is important, this is, an amendment presented by the deputy Ari *Vatanen.[
]The conditions of the States members differ among himself in many respects.[
]By means of the approval of this amendment take in consideration the fact that in the zone north can do a lot cold.[
]This does necessary also #take that this cold influences in the materials and containers.[
]Gentleman President, have to be flexible to the hour to dictate norms.[
]Have the hope that the Commission accept this amendment.[
]Gentleman President, no only want to thank his pal, the Mr. *Koch, but also to the Vice-president of the Commission for having  pronounced with so much clarity and without equivocal in favour of the security in the field of the transport and in favour of the priority of the security.[
]The Mr. *Koch has drafted his good report because in the *CEN and also in the frame of the Commission of Economy of the United Nations has not done  the work of way so *expeditiva.[
]It wanted to ask to the Vice-president if it can say us today how are the things regarding the endeavours of harmonisation of these two organisations and if the EU has the possibility to accelerate the endeavours of harmonisation with arrangement to the simplest principles possible.[
]Because it is clear that although in the heart of the European Union adopt an excellent regulation, the transport does not detain  in the borders but it goes further of these.[
]For this reason they are convenient, definitely, some wide regulations, that is to say, of regional field.[
]If the Mrs. Commissioner can not do this today, would be had to do to arrive by writing to the commission the state of things and the state of the negotiations among the *CEN and the Commission of Economy?[
]. Gentleman President, again reassert his congratulation to the Mr. *Koch by his work in east another report, that somehow comes to complete the debate that had in the month of October on the transport by railway.[
]All regret that the European Committee of Normalisation (*CEN) have not been able to #carry in the time required the modification of necessary disposals for a suitable harmonisation in the field of the European Union.[
]This debate and the modification of the directive at present in force allow us incorporate differential facts that speak of the diversity of our Europe.[
]It does a moment the Mr. *Vatanen spoke us of inferior temperatures, no already to the 20 low degrees zero, but to the 40 low degrees zero.[
]Of course we accept this amendment, has all the reason, and think that it is necessary to incorporate concrete circumstances that speak of the climatic variety of the European Union, that translates  sometimes in specificities and in concrete requirements to the hour to contemplate normalisations or characterisations of technical type.[
]I want to say, with regard to the manifested by the Mr. Swoboda regarding the activity of the *CEN, that are *urgiéndoles to that they accelerate to the maximum his work because it would be dramatic that, in spite of the new term, found us inside a year and beak in front of the same difficulties by not to have it concluded.[
]Finally, gentleman President, already have been signalled the fundamental problems that justify this modification of the directive, have referred us to the delay of the *CEN, to the modification of some disposals, to the coherence among the text of the directive and the content of the annexes, to the need to contribute a main precision.[
]All the contributions of the parliamentary commission and of the speaker, Mr. *Koch, that have translated  in distinct amendments, specifically in four, are collected by the Commission.[
]We accept, then , the four amendments that have been us proposed.[
]The debate remains closed.[
]The vote will take place morning to the 12.00 hours.[
]Coordination structural Funds\/Cohesion fund[
]. Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the report (*A5-0108\/1999) of the Mrs. *Schroedter, for the Commission of Regional Politics, Transports and Tourism, on the Communication of the relative Commission to the structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion fund: guidelines for the programs of the period 2000-2006 (*COM(1999)344 - *C5-0122\/1999- 1999\/2127(*COS)).[
]Gentleman President, is me particularly *grato that his first intervention in the European Parliament touch a question that has considered  of the maximum importance for the part of the United Kingdom that represent in this Parliament, to know, Wales.[
]As you knows, to an important part of Wales has given him  the status of Aim I inside the program of the Structural Funds.[
]It is quite evident that a lot of people of Wales trust the program of Structural Funds Europeans to solve some of the big difficulties that definitely are crossing.[
]We can appreciate the increase of the poverty in Wales, especially from 1997.[
]It has widened  the abyss among rich and poor.[
]Like this, we trust that with the program of Structural Funds no only restructure  the industry, but also that it improve the set of the economic base of the Principality.[
]However, what is us extremely hurtful is the belief that of the concession of Structural Funds is something that has been, in some sense, an attainment of the government.[
]Sadly, it is only a recognition of the big difficulties that is crossing Wales.[
]This is the reason by which want to underline some questions that think that the Commission has to have in first plan.[
]We have that the Commission #take the points related with the *adicionalidad.[
]We are dissatisfied with the fact that these figures look to have been somehow hid inside the set of the figures of the United Kingdom.[
]We have that the Commission also ensure that they exist funds adjusted to the projects.[
]We have this to defy to the Government of the United Kingdom, to ensure that the private sector, that surely constitutes the objective elder of the cost of the Structural Funds, involves  in the planning.[
]Finally, we ask that the Commission ensure that the money of the Structural Funds spends  of transparent form.[
]In this Parliament there are too many things that are not transparent.[
]This is a subject that *propiciará the friendship of the Commission and Wales.[
]Gentleman President, his commission treats these subjects from very diverse points of view, and, in the first place, will speak from the point of view of the investigation.[
]We consider that it is very positive that the speaker of opinion have incorporated to his own conclusions the proposal of our commission on the need that, in the included countries in the cohesion, expand  the infrastructure of the investigation *emplazando to the Upper Schools and other centres of formation of such way, that loan a better service to the inhabitants of the less developed zones and facilitate the permanence of the qualified people in their zones of origin.[
]This is possible by means of the adoption of measures by the public administrations, and this method of territorial recreation in the location of the Upper Education is, beyond all doubt, an efficient politics to level the development.[
]Another subject to the that wanted to loan our attention, especially from the point of view of the industrial politics, is that we had wanted to that, to the hour to schedule the coordination of the Cohesion fund and of the Structural Funds, the Commission had taken more in account the effects of the growth of the services, of the e-commerce and of the use of internet.[
]Before the poverty and the wealth #depend the structures of the economic activities.[
]The rich regions were those that had main number of places of work in the industrial state, but nowadays these zones can mean a load and to be even poor, and, in such a case, have to make new investments in the sectors called of computer production and of production of services, since it treats  of the sectors of the future.[
]This appearance has not been taken the sufficiently in account by the commission commissioned to elaborate the report, so, for the Commission of Industry, call the attention of the Commission on this subject.[
]Finally, we had wished, in our quality of Commission of Energy, that had highlighted  more the need to subsidise the renewable energies with the Cohesion fund and with the structural Funds, and like this had been able to  increase, applying the coordination of both Funds, the use of the renewable energies, so that the lack of financial resources of the energetic program had seen  compensated by means of the concession of these considerable economic helps.[
]Gentleman President, wanted to express his deep gratitude to the Mr. *Schroedter by his contribution to this question and for explaining to the pals that am speaking for their pal, the Mr. *Flautre, that it *sucedió in the Commission of Use and Social Affairs but that unfortunately is ailing.[
]It would like me that the people loaned attention to Amend them Numbers 1 and 2 agreed by the Commission of Use and Social Affairs that, however, have been refused by the Commission of Regional Politics, Transport and Tourism.[
]These amendments *versan on the social economy and on the need to provide main social risk and to lean plans of local financing to develop opportunities of use and strengthen the social cohesion.[
]The Parliament considered in the spent the social economy like an important potential provider of use.[
]These amendments also agree with the idea of this Parliament that the social exclusion is a grave question that requires a constructive action.[
]We expect that those that are considering to refuse these amendments offer to the Parliament and to the citizens of their countries that look for employ reasons very powerful to do it.[
]The Mr. *Flautre underlined in his report an area in which the coordination shines by his absence, although it needs  *imperiosamente.[
]The proposals of the Commission do reference to the four pillars of the strategy of the use and to the five fields of action of the Social Fund European.[
]But we have to regret especially the absence of specific guidelines, due to the fact that the idea to link the help of the Social Fund to the strategy of use will spend  to the practice for the first time in the program 2000-2006.[
]It could say that the omission suggests that the Commission neither has idea of the way to provide the maximum coordination among the help of the Social Fund European, subject to review after three years and half, and the annual plans of use of the States Members.[
]We expect that the Commission can ensure us that it treats  of an oversight that is remedying of constructive way.[
]. Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, the proposal presented by the Commission, fulfilling the mandate that has, is a reasonable starting point for the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development.[
]But to me it would like me highlight here that this starting point indicates us the challenges in front of which find us: maintain the population in the rural zones, in front of the changes that are producing  in all type of economic activities because of the increasing loss of weight of the agricultural sector among the diverse sources of income of the rural society.[
]This, joined to the deficiencies in the nets of infrastructures and services, and to an offer of use generally very scarce and at most seasonal and little diversified, stress the exodus of the rural zones.[
]The consequences do not do  expect.[
]They are the youngsters those that disappear, those that purchase formation and find use out of the rural zones, which *incide *desfavorablemente in these same zones.[
]This fault of infrastructures is an obstacle also for the implantation of companies and for the creation of uses.[
]It is necessary to #take that the rural space represents almost the four fifth parts of the territory of the European Union.[
]The agriculture only provides 5,5% of the use of this same Union.[
]Besides, the three fourth parts of their agriculturalists are it part time and need *complementos effective to their incomes.[
]For this reason, one of the more important and transcendental aims that would have to fix us in the European Union is to develop endeavours to create new places of work in the rural zones, out of the agricultural sector, in sectors like the rural tourism, the sport, the culture, the recovery of heritage, the implantation, the transformation of companies, the new technologies, the services, etc. Nevertheless, although the paper of the agriculture is not exclusive, keeps on being essential no only to avert the economic and social disintegration of the rural zones and the creation of other cities ghost, but also because the agriculturalists exert a fundamental paper in the management of the territory, in the preservation of the biodiversity and in the protection of the environment.[
]Therefore, we defend the establishment of an agricultural politics and of coherent rural development with the aims that have marked and that the rural zones, in the primes of the 21st century, have to be competitive and *multifuncionales, so much in the agricultural appearance as opening to the diversity of activities no agricultural.[
]It is important to prevail general criteria of ordination of the territory and of populational balance, and #take the conclusions to which the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development has arrived in five fundamental appearances, that have been collected only partly by the Commission of Transports, Regional Politics and Tourism in his points 16 and 17.[
]Concluding, I would ask to the Commission that these five points are #take to the hour to establish the conclusions of the four pillars because I understand that, for the European Union, the fixation of the population in the half rural has to be one of the aims *prioritarios.[
]Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, wanted pals, I wanted to begin their intervention appreciating the work that has done the Mrs. *Schroedter, speaker.[
]I think that it is a work very very made.[
]And besides, also I want to him appreciate his will of dialogue with the rest of the political groups to the hour to arrive to formulas of commitment in front of this avalanche of amendments, perhaps more than which expected , but that really answer to the importance of the report of the that are speaking.[
]For us it is important that the conclusions that approve  in this Parliament are #take by the Commission, like minimum in his spirit, because to the height in that we are could look that we are doing here an useless exercise, purely rhetorical.[
]But the truth is that we believe, and this reflects  also in the letter of the conclusions, that the Commission has to #take what approve  in this Parliament, fundamentally of face to the review of these guidelines to half of period.[
]In our amendments have fixed the importance that for us has the one who produce  the necessary synergies among the structural Funds, the Cohesion fund and the community initiatives, so that their application see  reflected of optimum way, of the most profitable way, in the progressive elimination of inequalities among regions and in the creation of places of work that, in definite, are the two fundamental purposes of the funds of which are speaking.[
]And to achieve a more fast and effective impulse in the achievement of these aims, think that is precise that take part in this initiative the generators of use, the true *emprendedores and those that for real guarantee the new sources of use, that are the employers.[
]Especially the small and average employers have to take part in the distribution of these funds.[
]If it is not like this, if the employers feel  *marginados, if the employers can not take part, do not say already only in the management, but in the reception of these funds, will have lost an opportunity to achieve our aims of way faster.[
]Also, to achieve our aims, to achieve surpass the inequalities among regions and look for sources of use is important to bet *decididamente by the new technologies, by the nets of transports and of communications and by the renewable energies.[
]And all this -insist- with the participation of the private company that, joining his endeavours to the of the public administrations, complementing and never obstructing or excluding, is the one who will create social wealth and places of work.[
]Gentleman President, is of his *incumbencia remember to his pal the Mr. Evans the reason by which Wales has attained in reality the status of Aim I. It is due to the discredited political of his own Conservative Party.[
]Leave me remember him also that when the leader of his party, the Mr. *Hague, went Secretary of State for Wales raped all the articles of the book of *adicionalidad, something that *propició a severe card of the Commissioner *Wulf-*Mathies around the requirements *regulatorios.[
]I can say him that the British Government is conscious of the requirements *regulatorios of the *adicionalidad of the Aim I. I suggest that the Mr. Evans go back to read the regulation.[
]My Group has done important amendments to the two reports that debate  today.[
]I want that we centre us in the important paper that exert the guidelines.[
]The aim is to provide a frame and a tool to lean and improve the economic regeneration, to achieve the most effective use of the resources with the widest supports and for *reconducir these regions to the path of the recovery and the development sustained so that in the long run they exit of the system of regional assisted breath.[
]It is important to identify the capacities and the potential of our regions in the sector of tall technology.[
]This is particularly important to the light of the reports in the means that suggest that Europe is losing quickly terrain in front of the U.S. regarding the growth of the industries of tall technology in the future.[
]The operation of the anterior round of programs is also very *instructiva because it suggests us what is what the guidelines do not have to produce.[
]They do not have to create layers of bureaucracy and additional paperworks.[
]They do not have to change the priorities and the politics while it is developing  the project, something that produces unavoidable delays and inferior costs to the planned, especially to the light of the new budgetary requirements.[
]The execution and operation of the guidelines can not leave to the personal interpretation of one or another department, neither of the Commission neither of the *funcionariado.[
]It has to exist internal coherence in the direction of the Commission to the time that respect  the specifically regional appearances and venues of the programs of the Commission.[
]The conclusion is that we have to do upsetting in that the guidelines are general, clear and flexible so that they can help to the agents of the programs and to the users of the funds and #take the potential maximum of our new fields of regeneration.[
]If we can *inculcar a spirit of business activity in our poor regions and *estructuralmente feeble, will situate them in the long run on the way to attract the confidence of the investors, something that will be the key of the future success.[
]It is as well as we go to judge the success of these guidelines: #depend if the regional politics of the EU, with good guidelines, solid and *capacitadoras, can open new opportunities and allow to their poor regions and *estructuralmente feeble exert fully their paper in the growth and the prosperity of the EU.[
]Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, distinguished pals, wanted to thank the Mrs. *Schroedter by his good report; she has applied  of full to the subject and has taken very well in account, during the work of the parliamentary commission, a lot of modifications that did  in this report.[
]The Mrs. speaker of the report also has ascertained, with all reason, that the Parliament has not been listened to time regarding the guidelines.[
]Now we find us seriously delayed in this question.[
]Anyway, it is to expect that the conclusions of the Parliament serve of help to the hour to revise the programs to the half of the period and in the practical execution of the same.[
]If we #take the phase of the period that live, the report has gone  expanding too much during his preparation.[
]In the report have included  specific subjects and some other questions that had been already present in anterior reports.[
]In this phase, the most important is to concentrate in examining the ways to pipe the regional politics of the Union through this process, remembering that the aim is to reduce the inequalities among the regions.[
]Their Group stands out the principle of subsidiariness: the responsibility of the States members and the importance of the local agents in the preparation and execution of the programs.[
]It is of a fundamental importance that the small and medium enterprises take part in the planning and in the realisation of the programs.[
]Their Group also considers very important that take  better in account the territories of *ultramar and the peripheral zones, and want to that it increase  the interaction among the cities and the rural zones.[
]We refuse the exaggerated *tutela of the central administrations of the States members and of the Union, and demand that it reduce  the bureaucracy that has infiltrated  in the processes of preparation and of execution of the programs.[
]The efficiency of the projects made with subventions of the Union has seen  *mermada, with too much frequency, owing to the slowness in the taking of decisions and of the complexity of the administrative procedures.[
]Often they have conceded  funds for projects that have not left any permanent profit in the zone of realisation.[
]It is necessary to achieve that the projects are more effective, flexible and productive.[
]With occasion of the preparation of this report, also has resulted very interesting to maintain a debate on the regional politics of the Union to general level.[
]It was the first time that the new deputies took part in a similar debate, and treats  of an extremely interesting process.[
]This report is stupendous and has the support of our Group.[
]Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, like test that this Parliament still has not surpassed the phase of consultative institution and subordinated, the excellent report of my pal of Group Elisabeth *Schroedter has not been able to arrive to the Plenary, because the plans of regional development for the period 2000-2006 of the territories of aim 1 already spend several months in the cabinets of the Commission.[
]Having all this in account, owe, anyway, demand, from this Assembly that, before they approve  the community frames of support for the quoted period, study them to him and subject them to him to debate in this Assembly to the light precisely of the orientations that today present, as we consider very special their capacity to create places of work in the poorest territories or less developed, with what will contribute to modify the negative tendencies to the existent inequality in the European society and to the advance to a juster Europe.[
]Gentleman President, would not have to forget that the main and strategic aim of the structural Funds and of cohesion, and of his coordination, is to achieve the economic and social cohesion.[
]We have the obligation to take part in the preparation of the guidelines and also in the evaluation of the results.[
]And this because we are the representatives of the citizens in the Europe of the Citizens, and no only in a Europe of the States and of the Regions.[
]We ascertain that the Funds are a necessary but no sufficient condition to achieve the economic and social cohesion.[
]If we take like only indicator the gross inner product by inhabitant, can make a mistake us.[
]Already some pals have spoken of the unemployment, of the descent of the demography.[
]It will be necessary to study a few indicators that allow us see the state and the evolution of regional societies that are in worse situation that others.[
]In some reports presented today in front of the Plenary of the Parliament remains clear that the 25 European regions more thriving have five times less stop that the 25 less thriving regions.[
]This obliges to the European Parliament, to the Mr. Commissioner and to the Commission to act of decided and strategic form.[
]I agree in that the European Parliament has not had occasion -or no has given him , for being the end of the term of office- to speak on the guidelines.[
]But I do not think that the report arrive late.[
]We need of a conjoint reflection so that the new programs of the Aim 1 and the plans of regional development that have elaborated  before the guidelines are operative can be subjected to a review and to a true assessment.[
]It is necessary that coordinate  the programs of the different aims. All coincide in asking that to half of the route of these programs, when it produce  the evaluation of the guidelines, the Parliament can be *coprotagonista, because we are the representatives of the citizens.[
]The citizens can not accept that the European Union take decisions of a form, at least apparently, bureaucratic.[
]They need that it work the political dimension, that there are responsibilities, that there is communication with the citizens.[
]This is what ask today to the Mr. Commissioner.[
]I want to think that he will agree, from his anterior experience of regional President, in proposing some indicators and a strategy in favour of the economic and social cohesion and no only of the productivity.[
]Gentleman President, give his support to the main proposals of the relative report to the administration of the structural Funds and the Cohesion fund for the period 2000-2006 and to the main recommendations of the report that advise the following: always it has to exist an integrated approach on the cost of the structural Funds and the Cohesion fund of the EU.[
]This means that it has to exist a full cooperation among the local authorities and the national governments regarding how have to spend  these funds.[
]It asks  to the States members that give a main importance to the integrated strategies for *revitalizar the relations among the cities and the rural zones.[
]This last point is of particular importance.[
]Although the urban renewal of our cities is very important, is necessary to look for always a balance in our politics among the promotion of the rural development and the improvement of the lives of the inhabitants of the cities.[
]It is not their desire build a Europe exclusively of cities.[
]The structural Funds have exerted a key paper in the development so much of the urban zones as of the rural of the peripheral countries, mainly through the modernisation of the roads, of the treatment of the waters and of the nets of corresponding transport.[
]This process will continue in accordance with the guidelines in matter of financial cost agreed by the leaders of the EU in the Summit of Berlin the past year, that received the support of the Parliament in the Plenary of the past May.[
]The key programs of the EU among 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have contributed certainly to improve the economic competitiveness of the peripheral countries and of the regions of Europe comprised in the Aim 1.[
]The key now is to consolidate and do permanent the progress that has made  to date.[
]This will ensure that the peripheral countries and the regions *ultraperiféricas, the poorest regions of Europe, are in situation to be able to operate successfully inside the new zone of the euro as well as in the field of an internal market in constant expansion where exists the free circulation of commodities, people, services and capital.[
]In conclusion, although the key projects of infrastructure have been funded by the European Fund of Regional Development and the Cohesion fund, have to remember that the Social Fund European has exerted a very important paper in the help to the less accommodated of our society.[
]The Social Fund European has improved certainly his institutions of third level, has funded our programs of education *postsecundaria and has put in practical plans of big scope to help to combat the juvenile unemployment and of long length, help to the pupils that abandon the school *tempranamente and promote levels taller of literacy of adults.[
]Gentleman President, in the past have dissented repeatedly with the speaker in the approach of the questions of regional politics; this time, however, agree with she.[
]I do not know if this animates it to be followed in the same direction, but, anyway wanted to leave proof of my congratulation.[
]The second that would wish to say is that we -as we had proposed the Mrs. McCarthy and I same, like speakers of the general regulation- would prefer that the guidelines had attached  like appendix to the regulation.[
]Alas it has not done  like this, and it is not responsibility of the Mr. *Bernié; it is thing of the anterior commission.[
]I leave proof of this to repeat the position of the Parliament.[
]The third that I want to signal is that, obviously, in general lines agree with the guidelines, from the moment in that they do not avert  of the observations that have done.[
]They constitute an important help for the States members. I want to highlight especially the importance that concedes the Commission to the question of the sustainable development, to the increase of the use, with special attention to the equality of opportunities, as well as to the subjects related with the transports.[
]By what to me personally *respecta am entirely of agreement.[
]Further of this, however, wanted to express my discontent like *isleño owing to the *desinterés by the development of the islands.[
]No it concedes him  the importance that would have to him  concede, and is not the first time that occurs; it is already an old history in these five years in which I am member of the Parliament and in which I have not left to pose the question.[
]Gentleman Commissioner, go to be followed posing it, because there is a forecast in this regard in the first paragraph of the article 158 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, that speaks of an integral politics for the islands, and the Commission will have to, in consequence, examine once and for all this concrete question.[
]From now, gentleman Commissioner, arrives at last the moment of the application of the programs, so that the States members will have to assume also their responsibilities and do well their work.[
]Regarding us, here in the Parliament, what want to remember is that it exists the code of good behaviour among the Parliament and the Commission, signed and in force from May.[
]Have the full conviction that this code goes to be respected and that the Parliament goes  to maintain informed of all the advances and of all the details of the application of these programs.[
]Gentleman President, I also want to congratulate to the speaker by the excellent work that has done.[
]I think that in the next years, in front of the challenge of the globalisation and of the enlargement to the East, Europe will need more than ever suitable and precise guidelines of face to the programming and the relaunching of his economy.[
]In this sense, Europe in his set, and each one of the States members in particular, will have to use the best possible all their resources and potentialities and, therefore, also the structural Funds that it has.[
]To do it is necessary a European Commission that, further of the good intentions, give main transparency to his lines guidelines and encourage  to the maximum in a task of control of the use of these funds by the States members.[
]Italy, for example, has had problems in the last years regarding the utilisation of the structural Funds, especially because of an excessive bureaucracy, an insufficient information and a scarce implication of the economic and social agents to scale local.[

]In consequence, two are the points on which wanted to call the attention of the Commission: in the first place, it does lacking to use the best possible the *concertación like system of coordination and of participation in the decisions of all the local and regional agents, so as to avert disequilibriums and inequalities; second, it is necessary an authentic work of simplification and of transparency of the administrative procedures that, with frequency, are too many long and complexes until the point that they prejudice the access to the Funds, of which regret  especially the small and medium enterprises.[

]And I end up, gentleman President, saying that it is rather grave that in the communication of the Commission have not devoted  a preferential attention to the territorial pacts and especially to the modalities of fight against the unemployment of the women and of the youngsters.[
]Gentleman President, as his pal the Mr. Evans, is for me a special pleasure pose this question in my first intervention in this Camera, especially because I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the *West *Midlands, that has benefited  in particular of the funds of the Aim 2.[
]But the report presented to the Camera this afternoon is a stupendous example of how, if we are not very wary, can produce ideas *grandilocuentes that lack substance to do them notable for the people that benefits  directly of them.[
]The report in yes contains good intentions but, as it is frequent when we treat these questions, suffers from of clarity of purpose and of a solid base for his operation.[
]This is the reason of why my Group and I are proposing three amendments and additional proposals key to the text, no with the intention to delete it everything of the proposal, but to do it more notable for which have to #carry.[
]It would like me explain here what think.[
]In the first place, we are concerned by the suitable use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion funds.[
]The past experience dictates that, like elect representatives of the European taxpayers, have to and have to demand probity and financial transparency in the outlay and the audit of this money. Therefore, our amendments and additional proposals save relation with attaining what know like indicators of "value in return of money" in the process of the concession of helps.[
]Second, we have seen with too much frequency that spend  enormous quantities of money in projects whose results are necessarily imprecise in the initial phase of the period of the program.[
]But, also with too much frequency, in the half point or at the end of this period there is not real way to end up the project if it has not showed  his efficiency.[
]Therefore, our additional proposals defend the provision of strategies of practical start and that can enforce  so that no only can have of the insurance demanded against the already purchased costs that they are used to  upload to the taxpayer, but also avert the very known syndrome to lose more money when trying recover the already stray.[
]Finally, we defend the introduction of a change in the balance and the method of outlay of the funds.[
]It has to have a main commitment of the private sector, that has to present the financial reality like an element of the equation of the funds.[
]Also, the type of project funded requires to #move of the in a small way based projects in the incomes, that are difficult to supervise, to plans of capital where in the majority of the cases all can appreciate with clarity the profits.[
]In this way the so *cacareada need of transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to resort unnecessarily the later possible to the base *tributaria venue in the zones where these projects develop  will diminish, and the European Parliament will show that it takes  with seriousness the need of this reform.[
]If the Camera leans today the introduction of these changes in the report, think that these will situate us in a phase *ulterior, in which they will achieve  the historical aims that the funds have to fulfil, that is to say, help of a financially sustainable way to the most needed zones of the European Union whose standard of living requires an increase, not to giving them alms, but a push.[
]I ask to the Camera that lean these changes.[
]Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, *señorías, wanted to also I congratulate to the speaker by his report; it treats  of an arduous and conscientious work.[
]It does not fit doubt some that the structural politics and the politics of cohesion of the European Union constitute the paramount tools for the creation of the conditions that #make the development and the progressive elimination of the economic and social inequalities among the regions; inequalities that, in spite of the advances registered, maintain  in levels very tall; *intolerablemente tall, by what *respecta specifically to the unemployment.[
]To achieve the tallest possible degree of success in the achievement of the aims of these politics, is necessary to coordinate them and organise them on the base of some very elaborated guidelines, intelligently elaborated, would say I.[
]We do not forget that these politics, when they are effective, result visible also for the European citizen, that benefits  of them and ascertains the immediate improvement of his quality of life.[
]We do not forget neither that it will be necessary to devote a particular attention to the most #move# away regions and to the insular regions of the European Union, then , owing to his geographic situation, confront  to fundamental obstacles in their economic and social development; to not being, clear, that the Commission propose  build bridges and underwater tunnels to connect them with the European trunk.[
]To end up, wanted to stand out that the structural politics in their set require main flexibility, so that they adapt  to the circumstances *cambiantes and that answer of this way to the new challenges and opportunities that present  with the arrival of the new millenium, for which all do the best votes.[
]Gentleman President, beyond all doubt the report of the Mrs. *Schroedter includes quite a lot of important observations, and congratulate it for that.[
]I Think, nevertheless, that would have to show more worry by the orientation and the results of the regional politics of the Community.[
]In bold strokes, the enormous massive unemployment no only does not dull , but it aggravates  even more in the frame of the structural politics.[
]The agricultural economy and the rural zones result *irreparablemente affected by the regional politics that exerts , with dramatic consequences for the rural use and for the conditions of life of the agriculturalists, in the South mainly.[
]The regional inequalities augment dramatically in the heart of the States members.[
]If we examine the data of the sixth report, will check that during the last decade register  enormous deviations regarding the average of regional development.[
]Minimum, if no non-existent, is the attention that loans  to the enormous problems of the insular regions of the Union, whose deficiencies in infrastructures, transports, communications and energy drive *indefectiblemente to the *despoblación.[
]Of all this are responsible so much the regional politics like the economic and social politics more general of the Union.[
]Wide sectors of the villages of the Union condemn vigorously this politics by dangerous and *antipopular.[
]The new guidelines move  alas in the same sense and at all does to think that it can change with the application of these guidelines.[
]Gentleman President, *Señorías, allow me say here some brief words to underline two points that these reports remember us and that have an essential strategic importance in the perspective that have of the Union.[
]The first is the essential and fundamental importance that follow attributing at the beginning of economic and social cohesion.[
]And we manifest worry by the news that arrive us that the importance of this aim goes waning in the spirit of the Commission.[
]We follow considering that the economic and social cohesion is a fundamental aim of the Union.[
]Second, I agree with the here heard words to a deputy on the question of the islands and want to also call the attention on the regions *ultraperiféricas.[
]It would like us that in the future there was more *osadía in the treatment of the question of the regions *ultraperiféricas, as they are, in the case of my country, the islands Azores and *Madeira.[
]And I take advantage of this occasion to ask if it can the Commission clear us the reasons of the delay of the report of the Commission on the regions *ultraperiféricas, that from does quite time expects  in the Parliament.[
]Gentleman President, in the first place, want to thank the speaker, also by the amiable received that has dispensed in his report to some ours suggestions.[
]Gentleman President, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, gentleman Commissioner, with the help of the guidelines pretends  offer to the States members an orientation to achieve the aims of the reform in the frame of the programming.[
]However the aims that in this regard it formulates the Commission, contrary to his purpose to provide orientation, represent rather a catalogue of offers of possible measures in the frame of the fields of the politics.[
]Nevertheless, his authentic sense is the one to indicate the direction and establish priorities.[
]I agree with the speaker in that, lamentably, the document of the Commission contains too few recommendations to the States members on administrative simplification and support some requirements, such as concentrate the attention during the negotiations in boosting a favourable environment for the small and medium enterprises, so creators of use, in establishing clearly aims for alternative sources of financing, including relative regulations to the capital of risk and to the private financing, in creating helps of initial takeoff to the companies, included the new technologies as well as the investments in the field of the innovation.[
]Support of special way an amendment of my Group to the section 10, which pretends to ensure a suitable inclusion of the private sector in the planning and execution of the projects.[
]It would celebrate a lot, lady *Schroedter, that you included this amendment in his positive arguments, precisely also under the appearance of the subsidiariness.[
]Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, in the Commission of Use and Social Affairs maintained the unanimous criterion that had strategic character and *prioritario lean the interventions of the structural Funds and of cohesion that worked by a better opportunity of use for the unemployed and by an equality among men and women.[
]Lamentably, the excellent report *Schroedter has not taken in consideration this criterion although they are multiple the evidences -and go it to see later in the report *Berend- of how, sure enough, these Funds are helping *espléndidamente to the most delayed regions to cover the distance that separates them of the most developed regions of Europe.[
]They are growing, but to levels of GDP.[
]They are growing in competitiveness, but does not arrive to all the increase of the wealth because it does not increase  the use and persists the difference of opportunities of use in ones and other regions.[
]Gentleman Commissioner, read you the opinion of the Commission of Use and Social Affairs and concede him character *prioritario, because this is the big problem of the citizens.[
]And in the review, in the assignment of the reservations, #take, with strategic character, the needs of use because this, in definite, is what require the structural Funds and the Cohesion funds.[
]Gentleman President, is necessary that the guidelines can orient correctly and reinforce the efficiency of the programs of the critic *septenio 2000-2006, so that the sustainable development and the creation of use, especially feminine and juvenile, do  at last reality, and that ensure  the balance among the social and economic politics and the environmental politics.[
]Special importance purchases the treatment of the sharpened problems of the cities, the maintenance of the rural use, the support to the agricultural zones and, clear is, the guarantee of equal opportunities of development for the islands of the European Union, and for the Greek islands, of course, that are the half of the islands of the Union, as exactly it contemplates  in the article 158 of the Treaty.[
]The politics of cohesion has to be consolidated and reinforced even more, because a Europe with enormous inequalities in the standard of living of the regions can not be neither credible neither viable.[
]The debate remains closed.[
]The vote will take place morning to the 12.00 hours.[
