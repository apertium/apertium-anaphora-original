{+Their+} *Señorías have requested a debate on the subject for the next days, in the course of this period of sessions.
According to words of [-his-] {+their+} President, is in conditions to do it.
I regret this, as we have to act because others have not made [-his-] {+their+} work.
We expect that those that are considering to refuse these amendments offer to the Parliament and to the citizens of [-his-] {+their+} countries that look for employ reasons very powerful to do it.
Besides, the three fourth parts of our agriculturalists are it part time and need *complementos effective to [-his-] {+their+} incomes.
It is important to prevail general criteria of ordination of the territory and of populational balance, and #take the conclusions to which the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development has arrived in five fundamental appearances, that have been collected only partly by the Commission of Transports, Regional Politics and Tourism in [-his-] {+their+} points 16 and 17.
For us it is important that the conclusions that approve  in this Parliament are #take by the Commission, like minimum in [-his-] {+their+} spirit, because to the height in that we are could look that we are doing here an useless exercise, purely rhetorical.
In our amendments have fixed the importance that for us has the one who produce  the necessary synergies among the structural Funds, the Cohesion fund and the community initiatives, so that [-his-] {+their+} application see  reflected of optimum way, of the most profitable way, in the progressive elimination of inequalities among regions and in the creation of places of work that, in definite, are the two fundamental purposes of the funds of which are speaking.
It is as well as we go to judge the success of these guidelines: #depend if the regional politics of the EU, with good guidelines, solid and *capacitadoras, can open new opportunities and allow to our poor regions and *estructuralmente feeble exert fully [-his-] {+their+} paper in the growth and the prosperity of the EU.
Having all this in account, owe, anyway, demand, from this Assembly that, before they approve  the community frames of support for the quoted period, study them to him and subject them to him to debate in this Assembly to the light precisely of the orientations that today present, as we consider very special [-his-] {+their+} capacity to create places of work in the poorest territories or less developed, with what will contribute to modify the negative tendencies to the existent inequality in the European society and to the advance to a juster Europe.
We do not forget that these politics, when they are effective, result visible also for the European citizen, that benefits  of them and ascertains the immediate improvement of [-his-] {+their+} quality of life.
To end up, wanted to stand out that the structural politics in [-his-] {+their+} set require main flexibility, so that they adapt  to the circumstances *cambiantes and that answer of this way to the new challenges and opportunities that present  with the arrival of the new millenium, for which all do the best votes.
However the aims that in this regard it formulates the Commission, contrary to [-his-] {+their+} purpose to provide orientation, represent rather a catalogue of offers of possible measures in the frame of the fields of the politics.
Nevertheless, [-his-] {+their+} authentic sense is the one to indicate the direction and establish priorities.
