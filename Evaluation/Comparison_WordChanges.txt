]As all have been able to check, the big "effect of the year 2000" has not produced . Instead, the citizens of varied of [-our-] {+their+} countries have been victims of natural catastrophes truly terrible.[
[-]His-] {+]Their+} *Señorías have requested a debate on the subject for the next days, in the course of this period of sessions.[
]The report *Cunha on the programs of direction *plurianual presents  to the Parliament the Thursday and contains a proposal in the section 6 around a form of penalties based in quotas that has to apply to the countries that do not fulfil annually [-his-] {+their+} aims of reduction of fleet.[
]It is, definitely, inside the line of the positions that [-our-] {+their+} Parliament always has adopted.[
]Lady President, in the first place would like me congratulate it for having fulfilled with [-his-] {+her+} promise since sure enough in this first period of sessions of the new year has expanded  drastically the number of canals in [-our-] {+their+} dispatches.[
]Why they have not improved  the stairs from [-my-] {+their+} accident?[
]According to words of [-his-] {+their+} President, is in conditions to do it.[
]Therefore, the proposal that does the Group of the Party of the European Socialists and that [-his-] {+their+} *Señoría has mentioned is that the Wednesday maintain  the presentation of the program of term of office of the Commission *Prodi, including inside this program also the project of administrative reform because, of not being like this, can find us with a paradoxical situation: with the excuse that there is not text, denies  by a part the right to the President of the Commission to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, that take place a debate on the reform without that this Parliament know previously the texts in that it bases .[
]We have argued, we express unanimity, with exception of the Groups of the *PPE and of the European Party of the Liberal Democrats and Reformist, and I same did to note -as they will remember it [-my-] {+their+} wanted mates presidents- that does not treat  to know if they are you in favour or against of the tax *Todin, but to know if they dare to comprise what think in this regard the Commission and the Council.[
]Lady President, has  *contabilizado [-my-] {+her+} vote, that has not been able to be made electronically, because I do not have the card?[
]In determinate locations of [-my-] {+their+} country produced  really a chaotic situation.[
]I congratulate him by [-his-] {+their+} excellent report.[
]I gladden me that there is also an agreement with the Council on the minimum requirements for [-his-] {+their+} examination, although it had preferred that they had created  some fixed and uniform norms, so that the certificates were equal from the international point of view.[
]Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated pals, first of all, wanted to congratulate to [-our-] {+their+} pal, the Mr. *Koch, by his reports, which perhaps are technical reports, but *revisten a big importance for the security.[
]In the first place, I want to ask to the Mrs. Commissioner -and am sure that [-my-] {+her+} desire falls in fertile soil- that devote a main attention to the question of the security, was this in road, in railway or in the fluvial roads.[
]*Brevísimamente, want to appreciate also the intervention of the distinct deputies and say them to [-his-] {+their+} *Señorías that the security is a priority of the Commission in the field of the transports.[
]In this sense, want to refer me also very in brief to the problems of the tunnels, to that have done reference the Gentlemen *Rack and Swoboda, that, undoubtedly, in the case of Austria, is a very sensitive subject, by what it is necessary to do endeavours to see how increase [-his-] {+their+} security.[
]I want to reassert [-my-] {+their+} gratitude to all those that have taken part and very especially to the speaker, Mr. *Koch.[
]The inactivity of the European Union would oblige to the States members to modify [-his-] {+their+} juridical norms *intraestatales for a short period of time, in concrete, until the conclusion of the works of the *CEN, which originates costs and unnecessary insecurities.[
]It is well that adopt  this directive now because, of the contrary, the States members would see  obliged to modify [-his-] {+their+} national legislations for a very brief term, for a period of transition, thing that, to his time, only would originate unnecessary costs and would augment once again the *quebraderos of head of the citizens in front of the bureaucracy of the EU.[
]I expect that [-my-] {+their+} proposal was taken in account in the vote of morning.[
]Gentleman President, if it allows it to me, wanted to manifest him first of all [-my-] {+his+} respect by the form in that you has #carry the agile change in the Presidency during the debate.[
]Gentleman President, no only want to thank [-our-] {+his+} pal, the Mr. *Koch, but also to the Vice-president of the Commission for having  pronounced with so much clarity and without equivocal in favour of the security in the field of the transport and in favour of the priority of the security.[
]. Gentleman President, again reassert [-my-] {+his+} congratulation to the Mr. *Koch by his work in east another report, that somehow comes to complete the debate that had in the month of October on the transport by railway.[
]. Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the report (*A5-0108\/1999) of the Mrs. *Schroedter, for the Commission of Regional Politics, Transports and Tourism, on the Communication of the relative Commission to the structural Funds and [-his-] {+their+} coordination with the Cohesion fund: guidelines for the programs of the period 2000-2006 (*COM(1999)344 - *C5-0122\/1999- 1999\/2127(*COS)).[
]Gentleman President, is me particularly *grato that [-my-] {+his+} first intervention in the European Parliament touch a question that has considered  of the maximum importance for the part of the United Kingdom that represent in this Parliament, to know, Wales.[
]Gentleman President, [-our-] {+his+} commission treats these subjects from very diverse points of view, and, in the first place, will speak from the point of view of the investigation.[
]We consider that it is very positive that the speaker of opinion have incorporated to his own conclusions the proposal of our commission on the need that, in the included countries in the cohesion, expand  the infrastructure of the investigation *emplazando to the Upper Schools and other centres of formation of such way, that loan a better service to the inhabitants of the less developed zones and facilitate the permanence of the qualified people in [-his-] {+their+} zones of origin.[
]Gentleman President, wanted to express [-my-] {+his+} deep gratitude to the Mr. *Schroedter by his contribution to this question and for explaining to the pals that am speaking for [-my-] {+their+} pal, the Mr. *Flautre, that it *sucedió in the Commission of Use and Social Affairs but that unfortunately is ailing.[
]We expect that those that are considering to refuse these amendments offer to the Parliament and to the citizens of [-his-] {+their+} countries that look for employ reasons very powerful to do it.[
]Besides, the three fourth parts of [-our-] {+their+} agriculturalists are it part time and need *complementos effective to [-his-] {+their+} incomes.[
]Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, wanted pals, I wanted to begin [-my-] {+their+} intervention appreciating the work that has done the Mrs. *Schroedter, speaker.[
]In our amendments have fixed the importance that for us has the one who produce  the necessary synergies among the structural Funds, the Cohesion fund and the community initiatives, so that [-his-] {+their+} application see  reflected of optimum way, of the most profitable way, in the progressive elimination of inequalities among regions and in the creation of places of work that, in definite, are the two fundamental purposes of the funds of which are speaking.[
]Gentleman President, is of [-my-] {+his+} *incumbencia remember to [-my-] {+his+} pal the Mr. Evans the reason by which Wales has attained in reality the status of Aim I. It is due to the discredited political of his own Conservative Party.[
]It is as well as we go to judge the success of these guidelines: #depend if the regional politics of the EU, with good guidelines, solid and *capacitadoras, can open new opportunities and allow to [-our-] {+their+} poor regions and *estructuralmente feeble exert fully [-his-] {+their+} paper in the growth and the prosperity of the EU.[
[-]Our-] {+]Their+} Group stands out the principle of subsidiariness: the responsibility of the States members and the importance of the local agents in the preparation and execution of the programs.[
[-]Our-] {+]Their+} Group also considers very important that take  better in account the territories of *ultramar and the peripheral zones, and want to that it increase  the interaction among the cities and the rural zones.[
]Having all this in account, owe, anyway, demand, from this Assembly that, before they approve  the community frames of support for the quoted period, study them to him and subject them to him to debate in this Assembly to the light precisely of the orientations that today present, as we consider very special [-his-] {+their+} capacity to create places of work in the poorest territories or less developed, with what will contribute to modify the negative tendencies to the existent inequality in the European society and to the advance to a juster Europe.[
]Gentleman President, give [-my-] {+his+} support to the main proposals of the relative report to the administration of the structural Funds and the Cohesion fund for the period 2000-2006 and to the main recommendations of the report that advise the following: always it has to exist an integrated approach on the cost of the structural Funds and the Cohesion fund of the EU.[
]It is not [-our-] {+their+} desire build a Europe exclusively of cities.[
]The Social Fund European has improved certainly [-our-] {+his+} institutions of third level, has funded our programs of education *postsecundaria and has put in practical plans of big scope to help to combat the juvenile unemployment and of long length, help to the pupils that abandon the school *tempranamente and promote levels taller of literacy of adults.[
]From now, gentleman Commissioner, arrives at last the moment of the application of the programs, so that the States members will have to assume also [-his-] {+their+} responsibilities and do well [-his-] {+their+} work.[
]In this sense, Europe in his set, and each one of the States members in particular, will have to use the best possible all [-his-] {+their+} resources and potentialities and, therefore, also the structural Funds that it has.[
]Gentleman President, as [-my-] {+his+} pal the Mr. Evans, is for me a special pleasure pose this question in my first intervention in this Camera, especially because I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the *West *Midlands, that has benefited  in particular of the funds of the Aim 2.[
]We do not forget neither that it will be necessary to devote a particular attention to the most #move# away regions and to the insular regions of the European Union, then , owing to his geographic situation, confront  to fundamental obstacles in [-his-] {+their+} economic and social development; to not being, clear, that the Commission propose  build bridges and underwater tunnels to connect them with the European trunk.[
]To end up, wanted to stand out that the structural politics in [-his-] {+their+} set require main flexibility, so that they adapt  to the circumstances *cambiantes and that answer of this way to the new challenges and opportunities that present  with the arrival of the new millenium, for which all do the best votes.[
